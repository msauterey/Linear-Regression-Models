# Linear-Regression-Models

In this class we study theory and practice of regression analysis, simple and multiple regression, including testing, estimation, and confidence procedures, modeling, regression diagnostics and plots, polynomial regression, colinearity and confounding, model selection, geometry of least squares. We will cover also shrinkage and selection methods for linear regression (LARS, LASSO, Ridge regression, and Elasting-Net).
